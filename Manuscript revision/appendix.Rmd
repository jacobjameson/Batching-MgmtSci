\subsection{B. Complier, Always-Taker, and Never-Taker Classification}\label{sec:complier}

This section describes the method used to calculate the share of compliers, always-takers, and never-takers in the context of batch ordering in the emergency department (ED). Our approach follows \cite{Dahl2014}, \cite{dobbie2018effects}, and \cite{eichmeyer2022pathways}.

\subsubsection*{Overview}

Compliers are defined as patients who would not have had their imaging tests ordered in a batch if they had been seen by a low-batch-tendency physician ("sequence") but would have had their imaging tests batched if they had been seen by a high-batch-tendency physician ("batcher"):

$$
\pi_{\text{complier}} = P(B_i = 1 | Z_i = \bar{z}) - P(B_i = 1 | Z_i = \underline{z}) = P(B_{\bar{z}i} > B_{\underline{z}i})
$$
where $B_i$ represents the batch ordering decision for patient $i$, $Z_i$ represents the batch tendency of patient $i$'s assigned physician, and $\bar{z}$ and $\underline{z}$ represent the maximum and minimum values of our batch tendency instrument (the highest and lowest batch tendency physicians), respectively.

Always-takers are patients whose imaging tests would be batched regardless of which physician they see. Because of the monotonicity and independence assumptions, the fraction of always-takers is given by the probability of being batched by the most conservative (lowest batch tendency) physician:
$$
\pi_{\text{always-taker}} = P(B_i = 1 | Z_i = \underline{z}) = P(B_{\bar{z}i} = B_{\underline{z}i} = 1)
$$

Finally, never-takers are patients whose imaging tests would never be batched regardless of which physician they see, with the fraction of never-takers given by the probability of not being batched by the most aggressive (highest batch tendency) physician:
$$
\pi_{\text{never-taker}} = P(B_i = 0 | Z_i = \bar{z}) = P(B_{\bar{z}i} = B_{\underline{z}i} = 0)
$$

\subsubsection*{Number of Compliers}

We calculate the shares of patients in each category by examining batch ordering rates for patients assigned to physicians at different points in the batch tendency distribution. Following \cite{Dahl2014}, we define the "most aggressive" batch-ordering physicians ($\bar{z}$) as those at the top 1 percentile of batch tendency and the "most conservative" batch-ordering physicians ($\underline{z}$) as those at the bottom 1 percentile.

In the first three columns of Table \ref{tab:compliance_type}, we estimate a local linear regression of $\textit{Batched}_i$ on our residualized measure of physician batch tendency. Under this more flexible analog to our first-stage equation, we find that approximately 20 percent of our sample are compliers, 73 percent are never-takers, and 7 percent are always-takers.

In the last three columns of Table \ref{tab:compliance_type}, we estimate our linear specification of the first stage, given by Equation (4). Under this specification, we can recover $\pi_c$ as $\hat{\alpha}_1 (\bar{z} - \underline{z})$, $\pi_a$ as $\hat{\alpha}_0 + \hat{\alpha}_1 \underline{z}$, and $\pi_n$ as $1 - \hat{\alpha}_0 - \hat{\alpha}_1 \bar{z}$, where $\hat{\alpha}_0$ and $\hat{\alpha}_1$ are the estimated first-stage coefficients. Under this linear specification, we find that 21 percent of our sample are compliers, 72 percent are never-takers, and 7 percent are always-takers. We also explore the sensitivity of the estimated share of compliers, always-takers, and never-takers to the exact choice of cutoff for the most aggressive and most conservative physicians. As shown in Table \ref{tab:compliance_type}, our results are robust to the particular model specification and cutoff.

\end{tablenotes}
\end{threeparttable}
\end{table}

\subsubsection*{Characteristics of Compliers}

We also characterize our population of compliers by observable characteristics, which can be recovered by calculating the fraction of compliers in different subsamples \citep{abadie2003economic, Dahl2014}. For any binary characteristic $X_i$, we compute:
$$
P(X_i = x | \text{complier}) = \frac{\pi_{c|x} \cdot P(X_i = x)}{\pi_c}
$$
where $\pi_{c|x}$ is the complier share estimated within the subsample where $X_i = x$, and $\pi_c$ is the overall complier share. The ratio $P(X_i = x | \text{complier}) / P(X_i = x)$ indicates whether compliers are over-represented (ratio $> 1$) or under-represented (ratio $< 1$) among patients with characteristic $X_i = x$.

Table \ref{tab:complier_characteristics} presents the sample distribution, complier distribution, and relative likelihood for different patient subgroups. Several patterns emerge. Compliers are significantly more likely to be female (ratio = 1.21) and to have normal vital signs at presentation (ratio = 1.13). Compliers are less likely to be tachycardic (ratio = 0.57) or to have any abnormal vital sign (ratio = 0.79). Compliers are also more likely to have laboratory tests ordered (ratio = 1.13) but less likely to present without laboratory orders (ratio = 0.49).

These patterns suggest that compliers---patients at the margin of physician discretion---tend to present with less acute clinical pictures. Patients with abnormal vital signs or without laboratory workups may have more obvious clinical trajectories that dictate a particular imaging strategy regardless of physician preference. In contrast, patients with normal vitals and standard laboratory workups represent the diagnostic ``gray zone'' where physician practice style most influences testing decisions.

Table \ref{tab:complier_complaints} presents analogous results by chief complaint category. Compliers are substantially over-represented among patients presenting with Falls, Motor Vehicle Accidents, Assaults, and Trauma (ratio = 1.66) and Neurological Issues (ratio = 1.24). Compliers are under-represented among patients with Abdominal Complaints (ratio = 0.62) and Fevers, Sweats, or Chills (ratio = 0.62). This pattern is consistent with clinical intuition: trauma and neurological presentations often involve diagnostic uncertainty about the extent of injury, creating opportunities for physician discretion in imaging strategy. In contrast, abdominal pain and fever presentations may have more standardized imaging protocols that reduce the influence of individual physician preference.

\item \textit{Notes:} This table presents the sample distribution, complier distribution, and relative likelihood for each chief complaint category.

\end{tablenotes}
\end{threeparttable}
\end{table}

Together, these complier characteristics help interpret our LATE estimates. Our instrumental variables analysis identifies the effect of batch ordering for the approximately 20 percent of patients whose imaging strategy depends on physician preference rather than clinical necessity. These marginal patients tend to be older, female, with normal vital signs and standard laboratory workups, and are disproportionately likely to present with trauma or neurological complaints. This population represents exactly the "gray zone" where ED operational interventions could influence practice patterns without constraining clinically necessary care.

The coefficients for the number of imaging tests reflect its role as a mediator in the pathway from batching to time to disposition. The direct effect of batching is not significant, while the indirect effect via imaging tests is significant and positive, supporting the hypothesis that increased diagnostic intensity prolongs time to disposition. This analysis is exploratory and intended to provide insight into plausible mechanisms, not causal mediation.

\subsection{Placebo Exercise}\label{sec:placebo}

We investigate whether the reduced-form effects observed in Section 4.1 are due to differences in batch ordering rates across physicians or due to other provider differences correlated with batching tendency. We examine this by studying reduced-form effects among patients with conditions that rarely require multiple imaging tests, as a falsification check. For example, consider a patient who arrives at the ED with an isolated ankle injury—a condition for which multiple imaging tests are rarely ordered. For such patients, we should expect to see no impact of physician batch tendency if "batchers" and "sequencers" do not systematically differ in other dimensions of care relevant to patient outcomes.

We restrict attention to ED visits for conditions which batching occurs less than 1 percent of the time, as a placebo check. We estimate reduced-form regressions of each main outcome on physician batch tendency for this subsample and the results are presented in Table \ref{tab:placebo}. The results show no significant association between physician batch tendency and patient outcomes for this subsample, providing evidence that the reduced-form effects observed in the main analysis are not driven by unobserved physician differences correlated with batching tendency.

This placebo analysis supports our identification strategy by suggesting that batch tendency is not systematically correlated with other physician practice patterns that might affect patient outcomes. However, we recognize that given the multidimensionality of physician behavior, we also present reduced-form results and maintain focus on imaging-related outcomes, for which such concerns are less pronounced.
