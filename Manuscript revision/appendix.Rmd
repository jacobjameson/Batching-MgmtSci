Exclusions are necessary to ensure sufficient variation in batching behavior for instrumental variable identification. Rare complaints are those with fewer than 1,000 total encounters. Low-batching complaints are those where batching occurs in less than 5\% of encounters.

\subsection{B. Complier, Always-Taker, and Never-Taker Classification}\label{sec:complier}


In this section, we describe the method used to calculate the share of compliers (as well as always-takers and never-takers) in the context of batch ordering in the emergency department (ED). The method follows [@Dahl2014, @dobbie2018effects, and @eichmeyer2022pathways].

First, compliers are defined as patients who would not have had their imaging tests ordered in a batch if they had been seen by a sequencer (low-batching physician) but would have had their imaging tests batched if they had been seen by a batcher (high-batching physician):

$$
    \pi_{\text{complier}} = P(B_{\bar{z}i} > B_{\underline{z}i}) = \mathbb{E}(B_{\bar{z}i} - B_{\underline{z}i}) = P(B_i | Z_i = \bar{z}) - P(B_i | Z_i = \underline{z})
$$

where $B_i$ represents the batch ordering decision for patient $i$, $Z_i$ represents the batch tendency of patient $i$'s physician, and $\bar{z}$ and $z$ represent the highest and lowest batch tendency physicians, respectively.

Similarly, always-takers are patients whose imaging tests would be batched regardless of which physician they see:

$$
    \pi_{\text{always-taker}} = P(B_{\bar{z}i} = B_{\underline{z}i} = 1) = P(B_{\underline{z}i} = 1)
$$

where the last step follows from the monotonicity assumption. Conversely, never-takers are patients whose imaging tests would never be batched regardless of which physician they see:

$$
    \pi_{\text{never-taker}} = P(B_{\bar{z}i} = 0)
$$

To estimate these proportions, we define the most aggressive batch-ordering physicians ($\bar{z}$) as those in the top percentile of batch tendency and the most conservative batch-ordering physicians ($\underline{z}$) as those in the bottom percentile. We then compute the share of compliers, always-takers, and never-takers using first-stage moments. Specifically, we fit a local linear regression of $\textit{Batched}_i$ on physician batch tendency, take the share of patients who receive batched imaging under the top percentile of batch tendency, and subtract the share of patients who receive batched imaging under the bottom percentile.

Additionally, we can characterize our compliers based on observable characteristics. For example, we can calculate the share of patients with specific clinical or demographic features who are compliers. In particular, we can compute:

$$
    P(X_i = x | \text{complier})
$$

This framework allows us to understand which patients are most likely to be affected by variation in physician batching behavior and how batch ordering decisions propagate through ED operational processes.

 
$$
    P(X_i = x | \text{complier}) = P(X_i = x | B_{\bar{z}i} > B_{\underline{z}i})
$$

$$
    = \frac{P(X_i = x \cap B_{\bar{z}i} > B_{zi})}{P(B_i | Z_i = \bar{z}) - P(B_i | Z_i = \underline{z})}
$$

$$
    = \frac{P(B_{\bar{z}i} > B_{\underline{z}i} | X_i = x) P(X_i = x)}{\pi_{\text{complier}}}
$$

$$
    = \frac{\pi_{c|x} P(X_i = x)}{\pi_c}
$$

This moment is calculated by computing the share of compliers for the subsample where $X_i = x$ (i.e., checking the moments of the first stage for that subsample) and scaling it by the unconditional share of that subsample, divided by the overall share of compliers.

\item \textit{Notes:} This table presents the results of a structural equation model (SEM) investigating the relationships between batching, the number of imaging tests, admission decisions, and ED length of stay (LOS). To address potential confounding from fixed effects (e.g., complaint type and time of month), all variables were residualized by regressing them on the fixed effects prior to the SEM. This residualization ensures that the estimates reflect associations net of the fixed effects.
\item This analysis is exploratory, aiming to understand the mechanism by which batching influences ED operational outcomes. While the directions and significance of these associations align with hypothesized pathways, these results should not be interpreted as causal mediation but rather as an exploratory investigation of plausible mechanisms. The findings suggest that increased diagnostic intensity is a key pathway by which batching extends LOS, with admissions playing a secondary role.

\item \textit{Notes:} This table presents results from a structural equation model (SEM) analyzing the relationship between batching, the number of imaging tests, and time to disposition. All variables were residualized to account for fixed effects of day of the week, month, and chief complaint by severity. The coefficients for the number of imaging tests reflect its role as a mediator in the pathway from batching to time to disposition. The direct effect of batching is not significant, while the indirect effect via imaging tests is significant and positive, supporting the hypothesis that increased diagnostic intensity prolongs time to disposition. This analysis is exploratory and intended to provide insight into plausible mechanisms, not causal mediation.

\subsection{Placebo Exercise}\label{sec:placebo}

We investigate whether the reduced-form effects observed in Section 4.1 are due to differences in batch ordering rates across physicians or due to other provider differences correlated with batching tendency. We examine this by studying reduced-form effects among patients with conditions that rarely require multiple imaging tests, as a falsification check. For example, consider a patient who arrives at the ED with an isolated ankle injury—a condition for which multiple imaging tests are rarely ordered. For such patients, we should expect to see no impact of physician batch tendency if "batchers" and "sequencers" do not systematically differ in other dimensions of care relevant to patient outcomes.

We restrict attention to ED visits for conditions which batching occurs less than 1 percent of the time, as a placebo check. We estimate reduced-form regressions of each main outcome on physician batch tendency for this subsample and the results are presented in Table \ref{tab:placebo}. The results show no significant association between physician batch tendency and patient outcomes for this subsample, providing evidence that the reduced-form effects observed in the main analysis are not driven by unobserved physician differences correlated with batching tendency.

\end{tablenotes}
\end{threeparttable}
\end{table}


This placebo analysis supports our identification strategy by suggesting that batch tendency is not systematically correlated with other physician practice patterns that might affect patient outcomes. However, we recognize that given the multidimensionality of physician behavior, we also present reduced-form results and maintain focus on imaging-related outcomes, for which such concerns are less pronounced.
