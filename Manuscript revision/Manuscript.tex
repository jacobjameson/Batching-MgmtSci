\ABSTRACT{Using detailed electronic health record data from two major
U.S. emergency departments (EDs), we examine practice variation across
physicians to uncover the operational impact of discretionary batch
ordering of imaging tests. We find that quasi-random assignment of a
patient to an ED physician who is a ``batcher'' (top decile) versus a
``sequencer'' (bottom decile) causally increases the patient's length of
stay, time to disposition, and the number of imaging tests performed.
Instrumental variable results show that discretionary batching increases
length of stay by approximately 65\%, increases imaging tests by 88\%,
and has no effect on 72-hour returns. Through a decomposition analysis,
we find that approximately one-quarter of the LOS increase is
attributable to increased imaging volume, with hospital admission as an
additional contributing pathway, and the remainder consistent with
increased coordination costs and decision complexity inherent to
managing concurrent diagnostic workflows. Results suggest that
discretionary batching may lead to clinical decision-making that
introduces bottlenecks in patient flow. Conversely, standard practice,
which preserves diagnostic flexibility by allowing information from
initial tests to guide subsequent decisions, offers an ``information
gain'' advantage over batch ordering: the information obtained from a
prior test allows the elimination of the need to order some future
tests. Put together, our findings indicate that discretionary batch
ordering is not an efficient strategy for managing diagnostic imaging in
emergency care, and interventions to reduce unnecessary batching may
improve both operational performance and resource utilization.}

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

Advanced imaging is simultaneously an emergency department's (ED) most
powerful diagnostic tool and one of its most significant operational
bottlenecks \citep{Rogg2017}. Advanced diagnostic imaging has risen
dramatically over the past two decades, transforming from a limited
resource to a cornerstone of emergency care
\citep[\citet{smith-bindman2019trends}]{Juliusson2019}. However, this
transformation has intensified operational challenges in EDs, where the
complexity stems from multiple modifiable and non-modifiable
constraints: limited equipment availability, complex scheduling
requirements across different modalities, extended wait times for both
image acquisition and interpretation, and growing backlogs in
radiologist reading queues. Because of this, diagnostic imaging
represents one of the most resource-intensive and operationally complex
components of ED care \citep[\citet{baloescu2018diagnostic},
\citet{poyiadji2023diagnostic}]{mills2015optimizing}.

Though critical for the diagnosis of many conditions, imaging is not
without consequences for patients. Imaging bottlenecks can significantly
impact ED length of stay (LOS) \citep{Cournane2016}, and undergoing
advanced imaging may expose patients to higher costs, increased
radiation exposure, increased incidental findings that may lead to
unnecessary follow-up testing, contrast-induced nephropathy, and
contrast-induced allergic reactions
\citep[\citet{Raja2014}]{valtchinov2019use}. Given these risks and
resource constraints, efficient diagnostic testing management is
critical for patient outcomes and ED operations \citep{naseim2015}.
Physicians have considerable discretion over how they order these tests,
and wide variation in diagnostic test ordering behavior has been well
documented \citep[\citet{Solomon1998}, \citet{Wennberg1984},
\citet{Daniels1977}]{Miller1994}. However, relatively little research
has considered how to manage test ordering strategies when this
discretion exists.

We consider an ED physician's decision to order imaging tests for a
patient as an optimization problem, where the physician must balance the
tradeoffs between the advantages of ordering multiple tests
simultaneously (batching) at the start of the patient encounter (e.g.,
expediting the diagnostic process if the tests are eventually necessary
for diagnosis and disposition) and its disadvantages (e.g., increasing
the total time spent in the ED because of unnecessary tests)
\citep[\citet{Perotte2018}, \citet{Lyu2017},
\citet{Traub2018}]{Tamburrano2020}.

Batch ordering stands in contrast to the more common practice of
physicians sequentially ordering one test at a time, reviewing the
results, and then deciding whether to order additional tests based on
the information obtained from the previous test. While this standard
practice may serve as a natural filter to prevent unnecessary testing,
it can also result in longer delays than batching when multiple tests
are ultimately needed. This tension between potential efficiency gains
and the risk of unnecessary testing is significant given growing
concerns about imaging overutilization in emergency care
\citep[\citet{mills2015optimizing}]{baloescu2018diagnostic}. Beyond
avoiding delays, the decision to batch should also be made with
consideration of immediate operational implications and broader
quality-of-care considerations \citep{Feizi2023}. This decision is
inherently complex, requiring physicians to weigh time-sensitive
diagnostic needs against resource constraints and the risk of ordering
tests that may prove unnecessary once earlier results become available.

This paper explores the causal effects of batch ordering advanced
imaging tests on operational performance and patient outcomes in the ED.
Specifically, we focus on batch orders that include multiple types of
imaging tests that cannot be run in a single scanning session. Using
data from two leading U.S. hospitals---Mayo Clinic and Massachusetts
General Hospital---we first provide evidence of significant variation in
emergency physicians' batching behavior. Batching varies significantly
among physicians working in the same ED, treating patients with the same
complaint and severity (Figure \ref{fig:Variation}). Using this
variation, we next investigate whether being seen by a ``batcher'' or a
``sequencer'' physician has implications in terms of performance metrics
such as length of stay (LOS), number of imaging studies, 72-hour rate of
return, and disposition decision (i.e., being admitted to the hospital
or discharged home post ED service). Finally, we shed light on the
circumstances under which physicians are more likely to batch order
imaging tests.

\label{fig:Variation}
\begin{flushleft}
\footnotesize{\textit{Notes:} This figure highlights the marked differences among Mayo Clinic ED physicians in their propensity to batch order imaging tests. Batch rates are crude rates calculated by dividing the number of patient encounters in which the physician batch-ordered imaging tests for a complaint by the number of encounters with that complaint.}
\end{flushleft}
\end{figure}

Generating causal evidence on batching presents several empirical
challenges: physicians' decisions to batch are endogenous, studying test
sequencing requires granular timestamp data rarely available in claims
databases, and establishing quasi-randomization requires detailed
understanding of institutional assignment mechanisms. Our study
addresses these challenges using detailed electronic health record data
from two leading U.S. hospitals---Mayo Clinic and Massachusetts General
Hospital (MGH)---that capture the complete temporal sequence of clinical
decisions, including exact timestamps of test orders, results
availability, and disposition decisions (Table \ref{tab:desc_stats}).
Our primary analysis leverages Mayo Clinic's rotational patient
assignment system, which assigns patients to physicians via a
round-robin algorithm independent of patient characteristics or
physician workload \citep[\citet{Traub2016}]{traub2016emergency}. We
validate our findings using data from MGH, which employs a wholly
different, non-random assignment mechanism. Our empirical strategy
follows the ``judges design'' literature
\citep[\citet{dobbie2018effects}]{Dahl2014}, exploiting variation in
physicians' tendency to batch as an instrumental variable for the
batching decision; full details are provided in Section 3.

\subsection{Main Findings and Contributions}\label{sec:contributions}

Whether batch ordering improves or hinders ED efficiency is an active
debate among emergency physicians. Proponents argue that ordering
multiple tests upfront---thereby initiating scheduling and preparation
for multiple imaging workflows concurrently---reduces total processing
time when multiple tests are ultimately needed; skeptics contend that
this approach foregoes the information value of sequential results and
leads to unnecessary testing. Our results provide causal evidence that,
at least for discretionary decisions at the margin of physician
judgment, batch ordering negatively impacts operational metrics. In
particular, our results show that the marginal batched patient
experiences a 65\% increase in total ED LOS and a 69\% increase in time
to disposition compared to patients managed through standard practice.
Furthermore, discretionary batch ordering leads to 1.2 additional
imaging tests per patient encounter (an 88\% increase) and a 40
percentage point increase in admission probability. These effects remain
robust even after adjusting for patient and physician characteristics,
laboratory testing intensity, and ED capacity. Through a decomposition
analysis combining our causal estimates with controlled associations, we
find that increased testing volume accounts for approximately
one-quarter of the higher LOS caused by discretionary batch ordering.
The substantial residual effect is consistent with increases in
coordination costs and decision complexity arising from concurrent
diagnostic workflows.

Examining the drivers of batch ordering, we find that physicians are
more likely to batch order tests earlier in their shifts and for
patients with higher acuity and more complex chief complaints. This
batching tendency, however, varies systematically across physicians and
persists even after controlling for patient mix, ED conditions, and
observable physician characteristics. Finally, we observe that batching
rates decline modestly during periods of major overcapacity (12.5\%
vs.~14.8\% during normal operations), suggesting physicians may become
more selective in their batching decisions under resource constraints.

Our results indicate that, despite the perceived workflow advantages of
initiating multiple diagnostic workflows concurrently, batch ordering
results in significantly longer processing times and increased resource
utilization without corresponding improvements in patient outcomes. We
validate these findings through heterogeneity analyses across seven
high-batching chief complaint categories, finding consistent
patterns---increased imaging without efficiency gains or quality
improvements---across all clinical scenarios. These findings have
important implications, highlighting that ED managers should consider
strategies to reduce discretionary batching to improve diagnostic
testing workflows. We shed light on these strategies and provide
actionable insights on how ED managers can achieve them.

\section{Related Literature}\label{sec:lit}

In EDs, physicians face a fundamental choice in how they sequence
diagnostic imaging tests: they can order multiple tests simultaneously
(``batch ordering'') or order them sequentially as information
accumulates. Batch ordering occurs when a physician orders a
comprehensive set of diagnostic tests at the start of a patient
encounter, typically covering a broad range of potential diagnoses. This
contrasts with standard practice, where tests are ordered one at a time,
with each subsequent test decision informed by prior test results.

\subsection{Physician Decision-Making Under
Constraints:}\label{physician-decision-making-under-constraints}

ED physicians operate under significant time pressure and heavy
workload, both of which substantially influence their decision making.
Workload management and carefully balancing the tradeoffs between speed
and quality of care are of high importance for physicians making
decisions in complex environments, such as the ED
\citep[\citet{leppink2019mental}]{Saghafian2018}, and these decisions
lead to multiple documented effects on physician performance. For
instance, physicians may resort to ordering additional diagnostic tests
when faced with limited time to interact with patients, a practice that
requires less immediate critical thinking than direct clinical
assessment \citep[\citet{pines2009trends}]{batt2016early}.

Moreover, increased stress and frequent interruptions can disrupt
systematic decision making and impair complex diagnostic reasoning
\citep[\citet{bendoly2011linking}]{chisholm2000emergency}. Frequent task
switching to manage simultaneous demands can exacerbate cognitive strain
and decision fatigue, prompting physicians to batch diagnostic tests and
defer complex diagnostic decisions until comprehensive results are
available \citep[\citet{skaugset2016can},
\citet{jaeker2020value}]{kc2013does}. By ordering multiple tests
upfront, physicians can reduce the cognitive strain of repeated
task-switching and decision-making under uncertainty. Accordingly, a
cognitive-load theory of batching suggests that the practice is more
prevalent during periods of high workload or complexity.

Significant variation in ED testing and admitting practices has also
been documented \citep[\citet{Coussens2024},
\citet{Smulowitz2021}]{hodgson2018are}. This variation extends to batch
ordering, where physicians differ systematically in their propensity to
order multiple imaging tests simultaneously
\citep{jameson2024variation}. However, understanding the drivers and
operational impact of this variation remains a significant gap in the
literature. Our study aims to fill this gap by examining the factors
that drive batch ordering behavior and exploiting physician variation to
identify the causal effects of batch ordering on ED operations and
patient outcomes.

\subsection{Discretionary Behavior and Task Scheduling in Healthcare
Operations}\label{discretionary-behavior-and-task-scheduling-in-healthcare-operations}

Recent work has examined how operational factors influence physicians'
discretionary behavior in test ordering, revealing that decisions about
diagnostic intensity are shaped by multiple operational pressures
\citep{soltani2022does}. Studies have found that test utilization varies
with peer observation \citep{song2017closing}, workload \citep{Deo2019},
and the presence of justification requirements \citep{jaeker2020value}.
While additional tests can improve diagnostic accuracy, they also extend
ED LOS and potentially exacerbate congestion \citep{chan2018efficiency}.
This tension is particularly acute in imaging decisions, where test
sequencing can significantly impact patient flow and resource
utilization \citep{Cournane2016}.

The decision to batch order tests represents a specific form of
discretionary task ordering that has received limited attention in
healthcare operations. While prior work has examined discretionary task
ordering in other contexts \citep[\citet{Ibanez2020}]{Ibanez2018}, the
unique constraints of ED imaging---such as capacity limitations, varying
processing times across modalities, and the inability to run different
imaging types on a patient simultaneously---make these decisions
particularly consequential. A growing literature examines how workers
exercise discretion over task ordering to improve system performance
\citep[\citet{Campbell2011}]{vanDonselaar2010ordering} but also how such
discretion can sometimes lead workers to ``choose the wrong task
operationally'' \citep{boudreau2003interface}.

The implications of batch ordering also connect to broader theoretical
work on task scheduling in resource-constrained environments. While
batching strategies often reduce setup times and improve throughput in
manufacturing settings \citep{Fowler2022}, applying these principles to
healthcare operations introduces unique complexities. Though batching
may streamline the diagnostic process by initiating multiple diagnostic
workflows concurrently (reducing inter-test administrative delays even
though the actual image acquisitions must occur sequentially)
\citep{song2017closing}, recent evidence suggests it may lead to
increased testing volumes that could overwhelm imaging departments and
extend wait times \citep[\citet{saghafian2015operations}]{Jessome2020}.
The information value of sequential testing---where results from initial
tests inform the need for subsequent ones---creates a fundamental
tension between operational and diagnostic efficiency that has not been
well studied. Our analysis provides novel evidence of this tradeoff,
showing how different test ordering strategies affect operational
metrics and clinical decision making. Our study advances this literature
by providing causal evidence on how physicians' test sequencing
decisions affect ED performance. Furthermore, we identify specific
mechanisms through which batch ordering affects operational performance,
allowing us to distinguish between efficiency gains from parallel
processing and potential losses from increased diagnostic intensity.

\subsection{Hypothesis Development}\label{sec:hypotheses}

Building on the literature reviewed above, we develop formal hypotheses
about how batch ordering affects ED operations. Though prior work has
identified the mechanisms driving batching behavior and its potential
consequences, the net effects remain theoretically ambiguous. Our
theoretical framework centers on the fundamental tradeoff between the
perceived efficiency of parallel processing and the information value of
sequential testing.

\subsubsection{Information Value and Test
Volume}\label{information-value-and-test-volume}

The decision to batch or sequence tests fundamentally involves whether
to preserve the option value of information. Sequential testing allows
each test result to inform subsequent decisions, potentially eliminating
unnecessary tests. When physicians batch tests upfront, they commit to a
diagnostic pathway before information unfolds, forfeiting this option
value.

Physicians under high workloads face cognitive strain from task
switching and may batch tests to defer complex diagnostic reasoning
\citep[\citet{skaugset2016can}]{kc2013does}. However, this cognitive
convenience comes at a cost. Without the filtering mechanism of
sequential information revelation, physicians must rely solely on their
initial assessment. \citet{lam2020why} identify this as a key driver of
overtesting---when facing diagnostic uncertainty, physicians order
comprehensive test batteries rather than allowing initial results to
guide subsequent testing. Given the documented variation in physician
testing intensity \citep{hodgson2018are}, with some physicians ordering
twice as many tests as their peers, batching likely amplifies these
tendencies by removing the natural stopping points that sequential
results provide. Therefore:

\vspace{1em}
\begin{quote}
\small
\textit{\textbf{Hypothesis 1.} Batch ordering will increase the total number of imaging tests performed.}
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Processing Time and Operational
Flow}\label{processing-time-and-operational-flow}

While batching strategies reduce setup times in manufacturing
\citep{Fowler2022}, the ED imaging context presents unique operational
constraints as noted in our review. Different imaging modalities require
separate equipment and cannot be performed simultaneously
\citep{Jessome2020}. This creates a fundamental bottleneck where batched
orders must still be executed sequentially, but now with a larger
committed workload that cannot be adjusted based on emerging
information.

Moreover, the cognitive load literature suggests that processing
multiple test results simultaneously increases decision complexity
\citep{kc2013does}. When physicians receive multiple results at once
rather than sequentially, they must integrate more information
simultaneously, potentially lengthening the diagnostic reasoning
process. This ``information overload'' effect, combined with the
additional tests ordered as predicted in H1, suggests that batching may
paradoxically increase rather than decrease processing times:

\vspace{1em}
\begin{quote}
\small
\textit{\textbf{Hypothesis 2.} Batch ordering will increase patient length of stay and time to disposition, as the operational constraints of imaging and increased test volume outweigh the potential benefits of parallel processing.}
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Clinical Decision-Making and
Disposition}\label{clinical-decision-making-and-disposition}

The medical literature recognizes ``diagnostic momentum''---where
abnormal findings, even if clinically insignificant, drive further
workup and more conservative clinical decisions
\citep[\citet{featherston2020decision}]{coen2022clinical}. When
physicians batch order and receive multiple results simultaneously, they
encounter more opportunities for incidental findings that may influence
disposition decisions
\citep[\citet{berlin2011incidentaloma}]{lumbreras2010incidental}. As our
review noted, physicians facing uncertainty and potential legal
consequences may opt for more conservative disposition decisions
\citep[\citet{lam2020why}]{rao2012overuse}. The simultaneous arrival of
multiple test results, particularly with incidental findings, may
trigger defensive medicine behaviors:

\vspace{1em}
\begin{quote}
\small
\textit{\textbf{Hypothesis 3.} Batch ordering will increase hospital admission rates.}
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Contextual Moderators}\label{contextual-moderators}

The literature on physician behavior under capacity constraints
consistently shows that resource scarcity forces more selective decision
making \citep[\citet{kc2009impact}]{kuntz2014stress}. When EDs face
severe overcrowding, the operational pressures documented in our review
intensify. Under these conditions, physicians may reserve batching for
cases where it is clinically essential rather than convenient:

\begin{quote}
\small
\textit{\textbf{Hypothesis 4.} The effects of batch ordering on LOS and test volume will be attenuated under conditions of major ED overcapacity.}
\end{quote}

These hypotheses provide testable predictions that we examine using our
quasi-experimental design. By leveraging variation in physician batching
tendency under random patient assignment, we identify whether these
theoretical mechanisms manifest in actual ED operations.

\section{Setting, Data, and Models}\label{sec:settingdata}

\subsection{Empirical Setting}\label{sec:setting}

Our study uses data from two large U.S. EDs: the Mayo Clinic of Arizona
and MGH. The MGH dataset, which includes 129,489 patient encounters from
November 10, 2021, through December 10, 2022, provides a robust sample
for validating the generalizability of our findings. Our primary
analysis, however, focuses on the Mayo Clinic data due to its unique
random patient-physician assignment, which enables stronger causal
inference. Specifically, the Mayo Clinic ED employs a computerized
rotational patient assignment algorithm that addresses many empirical
challenges in healthcare settings; see, e.g., \citet{Traub2016},
\citet{traub2016emergency}, \citet{Traub2018}. The system assigns
patients on a completely rotational basis to physicians 60 seconds after
registration in the electronic health record system. At shift start,
each physician receives four consecutive patients to establish an
initial load, after which they enter rotation with other on-duty
physicians. The rotation order is predetermined by the ED scheduler and
varies across shifts to ensure fairness over time. Critically, these
assignments are based solely on arrival time---the algorithm does not
consider patient demographics, chief complaint, Emergency Severity Index
score, physician workload, or the acuity of recently assigned patients.
To maintain system integrity, physicians receive no new patients during
their final 120 minutes and are capped at 18 patients per shift.

Our empirical tests show that this rotational mechanism achieves the
quasi-randomization necessary for causal inference. Unlike settings
where patient-physician matching may be influenced by triage decisions,
physician preferences, or informal routing practices, the Mayo Clinic's
algorithmic assignment removes discretion from the matching process. We
establish that, conditional on arrival time, patient-physician matching
is effectively random---a critical requirement for our identification
strategy that distinguishes our study from observational analyses where
endogenous matching could confound the effects of physician discretion.

The data include information on the timing of test orders, test results,
patient disposition, and other important triage metrics and demographic
features. We focus on imaging tests (x-rays, contrast CT scans,
non-contrast CT scans, and ultrasound) because, unlike laboratory tests,
these tests cannot be run simultaneously on a given patient due to the
different equipment and settings required. Therefore, the operational
implications of batch ordering imaging tests are more pronounced. We
exclude MRI from our Mayo analysis because an institutional policy
requires either inpatient admission for urgent MRIs or outpatient
ordering for non-urgent cases, resulting in negligible ED MRI use. MGH
does not have this policy, so we included MRI in its generalizability
analysis.

\subsection{Data}\label{sec:data}

Our primary data comes from the Mayo Clinic of Arizona ED, a tertiary
care hospital without obstetrical services, an inpatient pediatrics
unit, or a trauma designation. During the study period (October 6, 2018,
through December 31, 2019), the ED recorded 48,854 visits, managed
across 26 treatment rooms and up to 9 hallway spaces. The department is
staffed exclusively by board-eligible or board-certified emergency
physicians (EPs), a rare yet ideal setting for our study. Many EDs are
staffed by a mix of EPs and non-EPs (e.g., Nurse Practitioners and
Physician Assistants), both of whom are responsible for ordering tests,
which may introduce confounding factors. The Mayo Clinic ED is unique in
that only EPs can order tests, eliminating the potential for confounding
by provider type. Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, the ED uses a
randomized patient-to-EP assignment, eliminating some other potential
sources of confounding.

We conducted a retrospective review of the comprehensive ED operations
data, coinciding with the initiation of a new electronic medical record.
The data includes detailed patient demographics, chief complaints, vital
signs, emergency severity index (ESI), LOS, timestamps, and resource
utilization metrics. This period was chosen to provide a robust data set
while excluding the influence of the coronavirus pandemic. The data is
summarized in Table \ref{tab:desc_stats}. Hourly patient arrival rates
to the ED are shown in Figure EC.1.1. LOS is measured from arrival to
departure from the ED. During periods when inpatient beds are filled
(i.e., when patients requiring inpatient admission must ``board'' in the
ED due to lack of inpatient beds), the Mayo Clinic converts ED beds into
temporary inpatient beds, making the endpoint for LOS for ED boarders
when they are moved from their ED bed to their assigned ``inpatient''
boarding bed within the ED
\footnote{The Mayo Clinic hospital operations team views ED crowding and boarding as a hospital-wide problem and not an ``ED problem," and they have elected to convert multiple sites around the hospital including pre-operative areas into boarding areas during hospital overcapacity instead of the ED, assigning ED to be the location of boarders as a true last resort.}.

To improve power in our analyses, we drop encounters with rare reasons
for visit (defined as those with fewer than 1,000 total encounters) and
complaints for which a batch order occurs less than 5\% of the time
across all patients or for which no imaging is ordered. Since batch
orders are rare in these cases, our physician batch tendency instrument
could suffer from a weak-instrument problem if we included them.
Examples of complaints dropped include skin and urinary complaints, as
well as other complaints in which multiple imaging modalities are
unlikely to be indicated. Figure EC.3.1 provides a CONSORT-style flow
diagram detailing each exclusion step and the corresponding number of
observations removed, and Table EC.3.1 compares characteristics of
excluded versus included encounters.

Excluding these conditions does not introduce selection bias: Mayo
Clinic's random assignment ensures physicians see the full spectrum of
acuity and complaints regardless of our sample restrictions. We focus on
encounters where the batching decision is both consequential and
discretionary---precisely the population where our LATE provides
actionable policy guidance. Though our analytical sample represents 24\%
of total ED encounters, these cases account for 41\% of imaging resource
utilization, underscoring their operational significance. Finally, to
estimate a precise measure of physician-level batch tendency, we
restrict our sample to encounters involving only full-time physicians.
Our final sample includes 11,679 encounters, with chief complaints from
the following categories: Neurological Issue, Abdominal Complaints,
Fevers/Sweats/Chills, Falls/Motor Vehicle Crashes/Assaults/Trauma,
Dizziness/Lightheadedness/Syncope, Extremity Complaints, and
Fatigue/Weakness.

\subsubsection{Treatment Variable}\label{sec:treatvar}

Our treatment variable, \(Batched_{i,t}\), is an indicator that equals
\(1\) if patient \(i\) had tests batch ordered during an ED encounter on
date \(t\), and \(0\) otherwise. Batching occurs when a physician
simultaneously orders a comprehensive set of diagnostic tests, typically
covering a broad range of potential diagnoses. Again, this contrasts
with standard practice, where a single test is ordered, and subsequent
tests are ordered in sequence as needed.

We define ``batching'' in line with standard emergency medicine
practices and focus on batches that include two or more different
imaging modalities ordered within a 5-minute window from the timestamp
of the first imaging order
\citep[\citet{jameson2024variation}]{su2025crisis}. We focus on early
batching (within 5 minutes) because this represents the moment of
maximum diagnostic uncertainty when physicians must decide their testing
strategy before clinical information unfolds. Physicians cannot know
\textit{ex ante} which patients will ultimately require multiple tests,
making early batching a discretionary choice based on practice style
rather than clinical necessity. Each imaging modality, such as X-ray,
contrast CT scan, non-contrast CT, and ultrasound, is considered a
separate and distinct test for our study. In particular, we focus on
batching instances where the physician orders different imaging tests
because such tests cannot be done in a single scanning session (due to
differences in equipment and setting). Encounters where a single test
precedes subsequent batched tests (1.91\% of multi-test cases) are
classified as standard care in our primary analysis, as the physician
has initiated sequential information gathering before placing additional
orders. Sensitivity analyses conducted around this time window, batch
size threshold, and the timing of the batch show that our results are
robust to variations in these values.

\subsubsection{Dependent Variables}\label{sec:dependentvar}

The primary outcomes of interest are the ED's efficiency and
effectiveness measures. We measure patient LOS in two ways. First, we
measure the time from patient arrival until the attending physician
completes care and determines disposition, capturing the duration until
a decision is made to admit, discharge, or transfer the patient
\citep{Feizi2023}. This metric excludes delays related to inpatient bed
availability, providing a more transparent measure of ED operational
efficiency. Second, we measure a patient's total time in the ED from
arrival until physical departure \citep{Lim2024}. This total time for
admitted patients includes the duration until transfer to an
``inpatient'' bed, whether in the main hospital or designated ED areas
converted for inpatient use, encompassing boarding time and discharge
processing \citep{Feizi2023}. Given the documented right-skewness of ED
time metrics \citep{Song2015}, we log-transform both time measurements
to approximate normality \citep[\citet{Saghafian2024}]{Brown2005},
meeting the assumptions required for our regression analyses. As a
robustness check, we also examine treatment time (from physician contact
to disposition), excluding both waiting room delays and post-disposition
boarding; results are qualitatively unchanged and are reported in EC.10.

Beyond time-based metrics, we examine resource utilization through the
number of distinct imaging tests performed during each ED encounter.
This count variable captures tests actually completed with documented
results, not merely ordered---an important distinction since ordered
tests may occasionally be cancelled before
completion\footnote{Test cancellations after ordering are extremely rare and face substantial operational barriers. Once the radiology department acknowledges an order, cancellation requires physicians to call and request that the department ``push back" the imaging order. Furthermore, radiology departments often coordinate between modalities (e.g., CT and ultrasound) so patients move directly from one scanner to another.}.
This measure helps us understand how batch ordering practices influence
diagnostic workload.

To assess care quality, we track whether patients return to the ED
within 72 hours of discharge from their initial visit and require
hospital admission \citep{Lerman1987}. We focus on returns requiring
admission rather than any 72-hour return because this measure better
captures actual quality failures. Some ED revisits are planned or
expected---patients may be instructed to return for wound checks, suture
removal, or if symptoms persist after initial treatment. Returns
requiring admission, however, are more likely to signal potential issues
with initial treatment decisions, premature discharges, or missed
diagnoses. For patients admitted during their index visit, the 72-hour
window begins at hospital discharge rather than ED departure, ensuring
fair comparison across disposition types. We verify robustness to the
broader any-return measure in EC.10.

These measures allow us to evaluate ED performance across three critical
dimensions: operational efficiency through time-based measurements,
resource utilization via imaging tests performed, and care quality
through return visit patterns. By examining these outcomes together, we
can assess how batching behaviors affect the efficiency and
effectiveness of care delivery.

\subsection{Identification Strategy}\label{sec:identification}

Our goal is to estimate the causal effect of discretionary batch
ordering diagnostic imaging tests on patient outcomes (formalized in Eq.
(4) below). A key challenge is that the decision to batch is endogenous:
physicians may be more likely to order multiple tests simultaneously for
patients with greater unobserved severity, which independently affects
outcomes such as length of stay and return admissions. To address this
endogeneity, we exploit the quasi-random assignment of patients to ED
physicians who differ in their underlying tendency to batch order tests.
This ``batch tendency'' serves as an instrumental variable, leveraging
the rotational assignment mechanism in the ED to generate exogenous
variation in batching. We first describe the construction and validation
of this instrument, then present our IV specification and identifying
assumptions.

To construct this instrument, our empirical strategy closely follows the
literature that relies on the quasi-random assignment of agents to
cases, often referred to as the ``judges design.'' Papers in this
literature typically exploit variation in judges' sentencing leniency
within the same court. Similarly, we explore variation in batching
across physicians in the same ED using a measure we term ``batch
tendency.'' We use each physician's residualized leave-out average batch
rate to measure physician batch tendency. We use this residualized
measure of physician batch tendency because, if certain physicians are
more likely to work afternoon or weekend shifts (as Figure EC.1.1 shows
are the busiest shifts), the simple leave-out mean will be biased. A
residualized measure of physician batch tendency accounts for this
potential selection. This measure is derived from two steps following a
similar approach used in other applications (e.g.,
\citet{doyle2015measuring}, \citet{dobbie2018effects}, and
\citet{eichmeyer2022pathways}). First, we obtain residuals from a
regression model, which includes all ED encounters in our sample period:

\begin{equation}
Batched_{i,t} = \alpha_0 + \alpha_{ym} + \alpha_{dt} + \mathbf{\beta X_{i,t}} + \varepsilon_{i,t},
\end{equation}

where \(Batched_{i,t}\) is a dummy variable equal to one if patient
\(i\) had their imaging tests batch ordered on an encounter on date
\(t\). Fixed effects include year-month fixed effects, \(\alpha_{ym}\),
to control for time- and season-specific variation in batching,
hospital-specific policies (e.g., initiatives to eliminate excess
testing during a flu season), and seasonality in ED visits. We also
control for ``shift-level'' variations that include both physician
scheduling and patient arrival with day of week-time of day fixed
effects,
\(\alpha_{dt}\)\footnote{Day of week takes on seven values: Sunday, Monday, etc., and time of day are six mutually exclusive four-hour bins: 8 am–12 pm, 12 pm–4 pm, etc.}.
A vector of patient characteristics, \(\mathbf{X_{i,t}}\), including
chief complaint by ESI, vital signs, age, race, and sex, was included to
increase precision. Our primary specification adds further precision
controls, including laboratory tests ordered, physician characteristics,
and ED capacity, as detailed in Section 3.4. As stated in Section 3.1,
these controls are more than required for our quasi-random assignment
assumption. Under the assumption that we have captured the observables
under which quasi-random assignment occurs in the ED, the unexplained
variation---the physician's contribution---resides in the error term,
\(\varepsilon_{i,t}\).

In step two, the tendency measure for patient \(i\) seen by physician
\(j\) is computed as the average residual across all other patients seen
by the physician during the study period:

\begin{equation}
Batch Tendency_{i,j}^{phys} =
\frac{1}{N_{-i,j}} \sum_{i' \in \{\mathbb{J} \backslash i\}}\hat{\varepsilon}_{i'}
\end{equation}

where \(\hat{\varepsilon}_{i'} = Batch_{i'} - \hat{Batch}_{i'}\) is the
residual from Eq. (1); \(\mathbb{J}\) is the set of all ED encounters
treated by physician \(j\); and
\(N_{-i,j} = |\{\mathbb{J} \backslash i\}|\), the number of cases that
physician has seen that year, excluding patient \(i\). This leave-out
mean eliminates the mechanical bias that arises when patient \(i\)'s
case enters the instrument. The measure is interpreted as the average
(leave-out) batch rate of patient \(i\)'s physician relative to other
physicians in that hospital-year-month, hospital-day of week, and time
of day.

Figure \ref{fig:batch_tendency} provides empirical verification that,
while the decision to batch depends on patient characteristics, our
measure---batch tendency---is plausibly exogenous. The left panel uses a
linear probability model to test whether encounter, patient, ED, and
physician characteristics predict the batching decision, controlling for
shift-level fixed effects. As expected, patient characteristics strongly
predict batching decisions; for instance, patients with
Falls/Assaults/Trauma complaints are 16.2 percentage points more likely
to be batched compared to similar patients under similar ED capacity.
The right panel assesses whether these same characteristics predict
assignment to physicians with different batch tendencies. Importantly,
we find that patient characteristics do not significantly predict
assignment to high- or low-batch-tendency physicians. The coefficients
are near zero, with confidence intervals crossing zero for all patient
characteristics, confirming that, conditional on shift-fixed effects
(which account for mechanical rotation), the assignment of patients to
physicians with different batching tendencies is effectively random.
This validates the rotational assignment mechanism and establishes batch
tendency as an exogenous source of variation for identifying causal
effects.

\begin{figure}[t!]
\caption{Batch Tendency by Patient Characteristics}

\begin{flushleft}

The right panel shows that these same characteristics do not predict assignment to physicians with different batch tendencies.
\end{flushleft}
\end{figure}

We further document that (a) there is significant variation in this
measure, and (b) the measure is highly predictive of the decision to
batch. Figure \ref{fig:tendency} shows the distribution of physician
batch tendency and the relationship between batch tendency and batching,
where the relationship is illustrated via local linear regression of
batching against physician tendency. As shown, the probability of
batching increases approximately linearly and monotonically with our
tendency measure (see Table \ref{tab:first_stage} for more formal
results).

\begin{figure}[t!]
\begin{center}

\footnotesize \textit{Notes:} This figure plots the histogram of physician batch tendency along the x-axis and the left y-axis for all patient encounters.

Ninety-five percent confidence bands are also shown.
\end{flushleft}
\end{figure}

Together, we observe that batch tendency likely meets the criteria for a
valid IV. In the next section, we formalize our IV analysis and
establish its validity.

\subsubsection{IV Analysis}\label{sec:ivanalysis}

To estimate the reduced-form effects of being treated by a
batch-preferring physician (batcher), we estimate the following
equation:

\begin{equation}
Y_i = \mu_0 + \mu_1 \, BatchTendency_{i,j}^{phys} + \mathbf{\gamma X_i} + \nu_i
\end{equation}

To study the effects of batching on outcomes, \(Y_i\), we estimate the
following 2SLS equations:

\begin{equation}
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
\text{First Stage:} \quad & Batched_i = \delta_0 + \delta_1 \, BatchTendency_{i,j}^{phys} + \mathbf{\delta_2 X_i} + \eta_i \\
\text{Second Stage:} \quad & Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \hat{Batched_i} + \mathbf{\theta X_i} + \varepsilon_i
\end{aligned}
\right.
\end{equation}

In all cases, \(Y_i\) represents our primary outcomes of interest, and
\(\mathbf{X_i}\) includes the same covariates as in Eq. 1 and additional
controls for physician experience, physician sex, and ED capacity level
(ED capacity guidelines for Mayo Clinic are in Table EC.2.1). Note that
the subscript \(i\) indexes patient encounters, with the temporal
dimension captured through fixed effects in \(\mathbf{X_i}\). The
variable \(Batched_i\) may be endogenous; for example, injury severity
may be unobserved and correlated with the need to run multiple tests,
length of stay, and the likelihood of returning with admission. Hence,
we instrument \(Batched_i\) with the assigned physician \(j\)'s
underlying tendency to batch, \(BatchTendency_{i,j}^{phys}\). Standard
errors are heteroskedasticity-robust (EC.13 provides additional
details).

Table \ref{tab:first_stage} presents first-stage results from Eq. (4).
Column 1 of Table 2 presents the overall mean and standard deviation of
the dependent variable (Batched) in the baseline sample. Column 2
reports results only with year-month and day-of-week-time-of-day fixed
effects. Column 3 adds our baseline patient and hospital condition
controls. Consistent with Figure \ref{fig:tendency}, our residualized
physician instrument is highly predictive of whether a patient will have
their imaging tests batch ordered. Including controls in column 3 does
not change the magnitude of the estimated first-stage effect, consistent
with the quasi-randomness of patients to physicians with different
batching tendencies.

Furthermore, the batch tendency measure reasonably predicts the batching
decision, and the IV is not weak (F-stat = 171.9). For example, across
all controls (column 3), our results show that a patient assigned to a
physician at the 90th percentile of batch tendency (0.023) relative to a
physician at the 10th percentile (-0.024) is 8.2 percentage points more
likely to have their tests batched. The coefficient is greater than one
because the BatchTendency instrument has a narrow range centered near
zero (10th to 90th percentile spans only 0.047 units). A one-unit change
in the instrument is therefore far outside the observed range, making
per-unit interpretation uninformative. Instead, we interpret the effect
over realistic variation: moving from the 10th to 90th percentile of
batch tendency increases batching probability by 8.2 percentage points,
as shown above.

Robust standard errors are heteroskedasticity-robust.

\end{threeparttable}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{UJIVE Construction}\label{sec:ujive}

Leniency designs like ours, where many providers generate the
identifying variation, can suffer from many-instrument bias in
conventional 2SLS: the constructed first-stage fitted values
mechanically reuse each observation's own treatment status, creating a
small-sample correlation between the instrument and the structural error
\citep{kolesar2015manyinvalid, goldsmithpinkham2025leniencydesignsoperatorsmanual}.
This bias can be substantial even when first-stage F-statistics appear
adequate.

To address this concern, we implement the unbiased jackknife
instrumental variables estimator (UJIVE) as a robustness check for our
main 2SLS specification. While our primary design uses a single
continuous instrument---physician batch tendency---UJIVE uses the full
set of physician indicators, \(Z_j\), as instruments. For each
observation \(i\) treated by physician \(j\), UJIVE constructs a
leave-one-out predicted instrument:

\begin{equation}
\hat{\ell}_{i,-i} = Z_j' \hat{\pi}_{-i}
\end{equation}

where \(\hat{\pi}_{-i}\) is estimated from the first-stage regression of
\(Batched\) on physician indicators using all observations except \(i\).
Because \(\hat{\pi}_{-i}\) excludes observation \(i\)'s own treatment
status, the predicted instrument \(\hat{\ell}_{i,-i}\) is orthogonal to
the structural error by construction. This eliminates the mechanical
correlation that contaminates conventional many-instrument 2SLS while
preserving consistency for the local average treatment effect.

This estimator is asymptotically unbiased in many-instrument leniency
designs and yields valid standard errors even when conventional 2SLS
understates uncertainty. If our 2SLS results were driven by
many-instrument bias, we expect UJIVE estimates to diverge
substantially. As we show in Section 4, UJIVE estimates closely track
our 2SLS results across all outcomes, increasing confidence that
many-instrument bias is not driving our findings.

\subsubsection{Identifying
Assumptions}\label{sec:identifying_assumptions}

The reduced-form approach delivers an unbiased estimate of the causal
effect of being treated by a physician with a higher tendency to batch,
since patient assignment to ED physicians is random and conditional on
seasonality and shift (``conditional independence''). The
residualization in Eq. (1) allows for further statistical precision in
measuring the physician's tendency to batch.

Our instrumental variable approach, which aims to recover the causal
effect of batch ordering diagnostic tests, relies on three additional
assumptions: relevance, exclusion, and monotonicity. We reported a
strong first stage (i.e., relevance) at the end of the previous section.
The exclusion restriction requires the instrument to influence the
outcome of interest only through its effect on test batching. This
assumption is untestable, but we take it seriously and address it
through multiple strategies. We expand our precision control set to
include laboratory tests ordered, physician characteristics (experience,
gender, hours into shift), and ED capacity levels in addition to patient
complaint, sex, race, acuity, and vital signs. Additionally, we test
this assumption by performing a placebo check for rarely batched
complaints (EC.8) and various robustness checks in Section
\ref{sec:robustness}, including sensitivity analyses (EC.9) that allow
for plausible violations of the exclusion restriction
\citep{conley2012plausibly}.

To the extent that any residual exclusion restriction concerns remain,
our reduced-form estimates can be interpreted as the causal effect of
being assigned to a high-versus low-batch-tendency physician---a
policy-relevant parameter for ED managers considering interventions
around physician feedback or training.

Finally, the monotonicity assumption is necessary for interpreting the
IV coefficient estimates as LATEs when there are heterogeneous treatment
effects. It requires that any patient batched by a low-batch-tendency
physician also be batched by a high-batch-tendency physician. The
literature that leverages the judges' design typically performs two
informal tests to assess monotonicity. The first provides that the first
stage should be weakly positive for all subsamples
\citep{dobbie2018effects}. The second asserts that the instrument
constructed by omitting a particular subsample has predictive power for
that same subsample \citep{bhuller2020incarceration}. Figure EC.7.1
presents both of these tests for various subsamples of interest. In the
left panel, our residualized measure of batch tendency is consistently
positive and sizable across all subsamples, consistent with the
monotonicity assumption. In the right panel, we also find that our
additional first-stage results are consistently same-signed and sizable
across all subsamples. The coefficient magnitudes differ across
subgroups because rates of batching differ.

\subsubsection{Details on Our LATE Estimates}\label{sec:late}

Our 2SLS estimates represent the LATE of batch ordering for
``compliers''---patients whose testing strategy depends on the assigned
physician's practice style. This effect compares early batching to
standard practice, which includes both sequential ordering and single
tests. Though this involves a composite counterfactual, it provides the
policy-relevant parameter: the effect of encouraging comprehensive
upfront testing versus allowing diagnostic information to guide testing
decisions for patients at the margin of clinical discretion---those
whose testing strategy is not dictated by apparent clinical necessity
but rather depends on physician practice style and judgment. To better
understand this LATE, we characterize the number of compliers and their
characteristics following the approach developed by
\citet{abadie2003economic} and extended by \citet{Dahl2014}.

Specifically, compliers are defined as patients whose batched status
depends on whether their physician has the highest batch tendency
(\(\bar{z}\)) or the lowest batch tendency (\(\underline{z}\)).
Mathematically, the fraction of compliers (\(\pi_c\)) is given by:

\[
\pi_c = P(Batched | Z = \bar{z}) - P(Batched | Z = \underline{z}),
\]

where \(Z\) represents the batch tendency of the assigned physician.
Following \citet{Dahl2014} and \citet{dobbie2018effects}, we define the
highest batch tendency physicians as those at the 99th percentile of
batch tendency and the lowest as those at the 1st percentile. Using a
local linear regression of batching on batch tendency, we predict the
probabilities of being batched under the most aggressive (\(\bar{z}\))
and most conservative (\(\underline{z}\)) physicians.

Approximately 20 percent of patients in our sample are ``compliers,''
meaning they would have received batched tests if assigned to a
high-batch-tendency physician but received standard practice otherwise.
In comparison, 7 percent of patients are ``always-takers,'' meaning they
would receive batched tests regardless of the physician's batch
tendency, and 73 percent are ``never-takers,'' meaning they would never
receive batched tests regardless of the physician's batch tendency.
Complier characteristics reveal that marginal patients---those at the
boundary of physician discretion---tend to present with normal vital
signs, standard laboratory workups, and are disproportionately likely to
have trauma or neurological complaints. This pattern is consistent with
clinical intuition: these presentations involve diagnostic uncertainty
where physician practice style most influences testing decisions. EC.4
provides additional details on complier estimation and characteristics.

\section{Results and Discussion}\label{sec:results}

\subsection{Reduced-Form Results}\label{sec:reducedform}

In this sub-section, we explore the causal influence of physician batch
tendency on patient outcomes and resource utilization in the ED. We find
statistically and operationally significant effects of assignment to a
high-batch-tendency physician on every outcome except 72-hour return
with admission (Table \ref{tab:red_form}). Scaling our coefficients by
the difference in tendency going from the lowest decile to the highest
decile in physician tendency---equal to a 5.0 percentage point
increase---for interpretability, we find that assignment to a physician
in the top batching decile (relative to one in the bottom decile) is
associated with a 5.8\% increase in time to disposition, a 5.3\%
increase in LOS, and an additional 10.9 imaging tests ordered per 100
patient encounters. These findings highlight ED physicians' substantial
role in putting patients on a path toward longer LOS and increased
resource
utilization\footnote{For reduced-form results for a less strict sample see, e.g., \cite{jameson2024variation}, \cite{hodgson2018are}, and the references therein.}

\end{table}

The fact that our primary outcomes respond strongly to physician batch
tendency suggests that batching is the underlying mechanism behind the
effects. However, physicians could differ in other dimensions of
care---some observable and others not---which could be correlated with
batch tendency. EC.8 attempts to distinguish between and identify the
mechanisms behind the observed reduced-form effects. This mediation
analysis provides a crucial step toward a well-identified IV analysis,
which we present in Section 4.2 using both 2SLS and UJIVE estimators.

\subsection{Instrumental Variables Estimation}\label{sec:iv_results}

Next, we examine the effects of batch ordering imaging tests using the
IV strategy described above. We first analyze the effects of batching on
primary ED operational outcomes before examining its impacts on specific
test ordering patterns and disposition decisions.

Panel A of Table \ref{tab:results_table} presents 2SLS and UJIVE
estimates of the impact of batching on key operational metrics. Column 1

\end{table}

The UJIVE estimates with full controls (Column 5)---our preferred
specification---indicate that discretionary batching substantially
increases ED length of stay. The marginal batched patient experiences a
65\% increase in total ED length of stay and a 69\% increase in time to
disposition compared to patients managed through standard practice.
Notably, the estimates attenuate when precision controls are added
(comparing Columns 2-3 and Columns 4-5), confirming that our original
specification captured some correlation with general diagnostic
intensity. However, large and significant effects persist.

Discretionary batching also leads to more intensive diagnostic testing.
The marginal batched patient receives 1.2 additional imaging tests
(completed studies with documented results), representing an 88\%
increase from the mean for patients managed through standard practice.
This increased testing intensity does not appear to improve care
quality: effects on 72-hour returns with admission are small, negative,
and statistically indistinguishable from zero. These findings suggest
that discretionary batching results in additional delay-inducing tests
that do not add diagnostic value. Put differently, standard practice
offers an important benefit: the information obtained from initial tests
reduces the need for subsequent, non-value-adding but delay-inducing
tests (an ``information gain'' advantage).

Panel B of Table \ref{tab:results_table} examines how batching affects
the utilization of specific imaging modalities. The estimates reveal
that batching leads to significant increases in X-ray utilization: with
full controls, batched patients are approximately 96 percentage points
more likely to receive an X-ray (\(p<0.001\)). Effects on other
modalities---ultrasound, CT without contrast, and CT with contrast---are
smaller and not statistically significant after adding precision
controls. This pattern suggests that physicians who batch construct
comprehensive workups primarily by adding quick, low-cost imaging
(X-rays) rather than selectively ordering expensive advanced imaging.

Panel C of Table \ref{tab:results_table} presents estimates of
batching's impact on disposition decisions. The UJIVE results with full
controls indicate that discretionary batching increases the admission
probability by 40 percentage points. This also means that the impact of
batching in the EDs likely spills over to other parts of hospitals
(e.g., inpatient units), increasing their patient volumes. Increased
patient volume, in turn, is known to induce behaviors such as speed-up,
which can harm other quality-of-care metrics, such as 30-day mortality
\citep{Song2019}.

These results paint a consistent picture of the operational implications
of batching. Discretionary batching results in more comprehensive
diagnostic workups but also significantly longer processing times and a
higher admission probability, without measurable improvements in
short-term quality outcomes. The stability of estimates across 2SLS and
UJIVE specifications, and the expected minor attenuation when adding
precision controls, strengthens confidence that these findings reflect
the causal effect of imaging-specific batching behavior rather than
general physician diagnostic style.

\subsection{Potential Mechanism: Decomposition
Analysis}\label{sec:mediation}

To understand the channels through which batching increases LOS and time
to disposition, we decompose the total causal effect into components
attributable to imaging volume and admission decisions. These variables
are natural candidates: our IV estimates establish that batching
causally increases both (Table \ref{tab:results_table}), and each has
clear theoretical reasons to extend processing times. Figure
\ref{fig:dag} formalizes these pathways, with admission relevant only
for LOS (Part A) since disposition time by definition excludes
post-disposition delays (Part
B).\footnote{Of note, a change in admission decision (discharge vs.\ admit) in the ED can influence a patient's LOS (Part A) but not their time to disposition (Part B), since the latter by definition excludes delays after the disposition decision.}

\begin{figure}[t!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/dag.png}
\caption{Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of Hypothesized Mechanisms}
\label{fig:dag}
\end{figure}

We employ two complementary approaches. Our first multiplies the
IV-estimated causal effect of batching on each mediator
(\(\hat{\alpha}_k\)) by the controlled OLS association between that
mediator and the outcome (\(\hat{\beta}_k\)). The implied indirect
effect through channel \(k\) is \(\hat{\alpha}_k \times \hat{\beta}_k\),
and the residual is the difference between the total IV effect and the
sum of indirect effects. This approach requires that the OLS
associations approximate the causal mediator--outcome relationships
conditional on our controls---an assumption made more plausible by the
breadth of our control set but not directly testable. We therefore
interpret the decomposition as an approximate accounting of magnitudes
rather than a precise causal partition. Our second approach examines how
the reduced-form coefficient on batch tendency attenuates when mediators
are added as controls. While adding post-treatment variables introduces
bias in the strict causal sense, the degree of attenuation provides
model-free evidence about the importance of each channel---an approach
commonly used in the judge-leniency literature as complementary evidence
for mechanism identification
\citep[e.g.,][]{dobbie2018effects, doyle2015measuring}.

Table \ref{tab:decomp} presents both sets of results. Panel A shows the
product-of-coefficients decomposition. For LOS, approximately 26\% of
the total causal effect (\(0.154\) of \(0.597\) log points) is
consistent with operating through increased imaging volume: batching
causally increases imaging by \(1.24\) tests (from Table
ref\{tab:results\_table\}), and each additional test is associated with
a \(12.4\%\) increase in LOS conditional on
controls.\footnote{These total effects are consistent with our preferred UJIVE estimates in Table \ref{tab:results_table}; we use 2SLS here because the decomposition is constructed around the batch tendency instrument.}
The admission channel accounts for a smaller share (approximately 3\%),
likely attenuated by conditioning on complaint-by-ESI interactions that
strongly predict both admission and LOS. The remaining 71\% constitutes
a residual capturing other channels: coordination delays from managing
concurrent imaging workflows, cognitive complexity of processing
simultaneous results, and scanner scheduling bottlenecks. For
disposition time, where admission is not a mediator, the imaging channel
accounts for 6\% of the total effect, with the larger residual
consistent with batching affecting decision-making speed through
information complexity rather than test count alone. Importantly, this
residual does not suggest an exclusion restriction violation. The
residual concerns the treatment not the instrument, reflecting channels
through which batching affects LOS beyond imaging count and admission,
which is expected given the crudeness of these mediators relative to the
full set of operational mechanisms batching engages.

$^{***} p < 0.001$.
\end{flushleft}
\end{threeparttable}
\end{table}

Panel B presents the reduced-form attenuation results, which corroborate
the decomposition. When imaging volume is added to the baseline
reduced-form specification, the batch tendency coefficient on LOS falls
from \(1.046\) to \(0.786\), a \(24.9\%\) reduction. Further adding
admission produces a total attenuation of \(26.5\%\)---closely matching
the \(29\%\) combined indirect share from Panel A. For disposition time,
adding imaging attenuates the coefficient by \(8.0\%\) (from \(1.140\)
to \(1.049\)), consistent with the \(6\%\) share from the
product-of-coefficients approach. The convergence across these two
independent approaches strengthens confidence in the decomposition.

Together, both approaches provide convergent evidence that increased
imaging volume is a quantitatively important---though not
exclusive---channel through which batching extends processing times.
These findings reinforce that the operational costs of discretionary
batching arise substantially from the increased diagnostic activity it
generates, consistent with the ``information gain'' advantage of
standard practice, which uses initial test results to filter out
unnecessary subsequent testing.

\subsection{Heterogeneity Across Clinical
Presentations}\label{sec:heterogeneity_complaints}

Our sample includes seven chief complaint categories that vary
substantially in both clinical complexity and prevalence of batching,
ranging from 7\% for fevers to 24\% for polytrauma cases. To assess
whether the effects of batching depend on clinical presentation, we
estimate our primary 2SLS specification separately for each complaint
category. This analysis allows us to determine whether the operational
inefficiencies we document are driven by specific clinical scenarios or
represent a more general phenomenon.

Figure \ref{fig:heterogeneity} presents these results. We frame this as
an exploratory analysis given multiple-hypothesis-testing concerns
across seven categories and three outcomes. Rather than emphasizing
statistical significance in subgroups, we focus on whether any clinical
scenario shows qualitatively different patterns in direction or
magnitude.

\begin{figure}[t!] 
\centering 
\caption{Heterogeneity in Batch Ordering Effects by Chief Complaint} \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../outputs/figures/heterogeneity_by_complaint.png} 
\label{fig:heterogeneity} 
\begin{flushleft} 
\footnotesize \textit{Notes:} Each panel shows 2SLS estimates of batching effects for different chief complaints, ordered by batching rate. Error bars show 95\% confidence intervals. All models include full controls. 
\end{flushleft} 
\end{figure}

The results reveal striking consistency across clinical presentations.
Imaging effects are positive across all seven complaint categories,
ranging from 1.03 to 1.76 additional tests, with six of seven showing
statistically significant increases despite smaller subgroup sample
sizes. Notably, Falls/MVA/Assaults/Trauma---our most complex category
with the highest batching rate (24\%)---shows a 1.13-test increase,
comparable to simpler presentations. Time effects similarly show no
evidence of efficiency gains in any category; the complaint-specific
effects on log LOS closely track the pooled estimate and are uniformly
non-negative. Quality effects, measured by 72-hour returns with
admission, are small and statistically indistinguishable from zero
across all seven complaints.

This consistency suggests that the operational inefficiencies of
discretionary batching are not artifacts of specific clinical scenarios.
Even in complex presentations where comprehensive imaging might seem
most justified, standard practice --- preserving diagnostic flexibility
yields operational performance that is similar or better without
compromising care quality. These findings simplify policy
recommendations: interventions to reduce unnecessary batching appear
warranted across the full spectrum of ED presentations, not only for
particular complaint types.

\subsection{Heterogeneity Across ED Capacity Status}\label{sec:HTEs}

Given that ED capacity constraints significantly influence operational
decisions, we examine whether the effects of batching vary across
different capacity levels. Following the Mayo Clinic ED's internal
guidelines\footnote{The ED of our other partner hospital (MGH) does not follow these guidelines. Hence, we did not include these analyses in our study of the effects of batching at MGH (see Section \ref{sec:generalize} for our analysis using MGH data).}
(Table EC.2.1), we categorize each encounter into three categories:
occurring during normal operations, minor overcapacity, or major
overcapacity. While our primary analysis controls for capacity status,
stratifying by this variable allows us to assess Hypothesis 4---whether
the effects of batching are attenuated under severe resource
constraints.

Table \ref{tab:het_effects} presents 2SLS estimates stratified by ED
capacity status. We observe that batching rates decline modestly as
capacity constraints intensify: from 14.8\% during normal operations to
12.7\% under minor overcapacity and 12.5\% under major overcapacity.
This pattern suggests that physicians become somewhat more selective in
their batching decisions when facing resource constraints.

$^{***}p<0.001$.
\end{flushleft}
\end{threeparttable}
\end{table}

However, we do not find statistically significant differences in the
effects of batching across capacity levels. During normal operations,
batching increases LOS by approximately 83\% (Column 1), while under
minor overcapacity, the effect is similar at 90\% (Column 2). Given
major overcapacity, the point estimate is smaller (36\%) and not
statistically significant. However, the confidence intervals are wide
due to the smaller sample size (n=1,083), and we cannot reject the
hypothesis that the effect equals that observed under normal operations.
Similarly, imaging volume effects remain large and significant across
all capacity levels, ranging from 1.17 to 1.91 additional tests per
batched patient.

These results do not support Hypothesis 4. While batching rates decline
modestly under overcapacity---suggesting physicians exercise somewhat
greater selectivity---the estimated effects of batching on outcomes
remain statistically indistinguishable across capacity levels. The
operational inefficiencies associated with discretionary batching
persist regardless of ED utilization. From a policy perspective, this
suggests that interventions to reduce unnecessary batching are warranted
across all operational contexts, not only during periods of normal
capacity.

\subsection{Determinants of Image Batching}\label{sec:determinants}

To investigate the drivers of batching and image ordering behavior, we
examine the relationship between physician characteristics, ED crowding,
and the likelihood of batched testing. We estimate the following
regression models:

\small

\begin{equation}
Y_{i,j} = \beta_0 + \mathbf{\beta_1 MD_j} + \gamma Capacity + \mathbf{\alpha X_{i}} + \epsilon_i
\end{equation} \normalsize

Where \(Y_{i,j}\) represents our outcome of interest: Batched, a binary
measure of whether physician \(j\) batched tests for patient \(i\), and
the number of distinct imaging tests performed for patient \(i\) by
physician \(j\). \(\mathbf{MD_j}\) is a vector of physician
characteristics, including years since residency graduation, whether the
physician is male, and the number of hours they are into their shift.
\(Capacity\) is the current capacity level of the ED, defined in Table
EC.2.1. \(\mathbf{X_{i}}\) is the vector of patient covariates described
in the previous section and in Figure \ref{fig:batch_tendency}. Table
\ref{tab:determinants} presents the results.

\end{flushleft}
\end{threeparttable}
\end{table}

We find that physician experience is associated with modest reductions
in both batching and overall imaging volume. Each additional year since
residency is associated with a 0.1 percentage-point decrease in the
probability of batching (\(p<0.05\)) and 0.3 fewer imaging tests per 100
encounters (\(p<0.001\)). Physician gender shows no significant
relationship with either batching or test volume.

The timing within a physician's shift significantly influences batching
decisions. For each additional hour into the shift, the likelihood of
batching decreases by 0.4 percentage points (\(p<0.05\)), though hours
into the shift show no significant relationship with overall imaging
volume. Because the Mayo Clinic ED features very few handoffs and
physicians tend to stay with their patients until disposition, this
decline in batching as shifts progress may reflect physicians adopting
more conservative testing strategies to ensure they can complete their
work before their shift ends.

ED capacity conditions also influence test ordering patterns. Under
minor overcapacity, we observe significant decreases in both batching
(1.7 percentage points, \(p<0.01\)) and imaging volume (2.6 fewer tests
per 100 encounters, \(p<0.05\)). Given major overcapacity, point
estimates suggest reductions relative to normal operations, but these
effects are not statistically significant---likely due to the smaller
number of encounters during these periods (n=1,083). This pattern is
consistent with physicians becoming more selective in their ordering
behavior when facing resource constraints, though the relationship is
modest in magnitude.

\subsection{Generalizability of Results Across
EDs}\label{sec:generalize}

To assess the generalizability of our findings beyond the Mayo Clinic
ED, we replicated our analysis using data from the MGH ED, one of the
busiest emergency departments in the United States. The MGH dataset
comprises 129,489 patient encounters from November 10, 2021, through
December 10, 2022. This extensive dataset provides a robust sample to
validate the external applicability of our results.

Unlike the Mayo Clinic ED, where patients are randomly assigned to
physicians upon arrival through a rotational system, the MGH ED employs
a different patient assignment mechanism. At MGH, patients are triaged
into different care areas (e.g., urgent care, fast track, observation)
based on acuity and presenting complaints, then assigned to physicians
based on availability within those areas rather than through random
rotation. To address this non-random assignment and potential selection
bias, we adjust our instrumental variable strategy to account for these
differences by including additional covariates for care area assignment,
acuity level, and presenting complaints in both stages of our 2SLS and
instrument construction, thereby accounting for the sorting of patients
into different ED zones. While this approach cannot guarantee the same
level of causal identification as making use of Mayo Clinic's randomized
system, it provides a more robust comparison of the effects of batching
on patient outcomes across different ED settings

After adjusting for institutional differences and using the same
exclusion criteria we used with Mayo, we find strong evidence that our
key findings generalize to the MGH setting. The 2SLS results in Table 7
suggest that batching leads to a 40.5\% increase in length of stay and
approximately 1.8 additional imaging tests per patient. To formally
assess whether the estimated effects differ significantly across the two
ED settings, we conduct a Z-test comparing the 2SLS coefficients from
MGH and Mayo by estimating:

\[
Z = \frac{\hat{\beta}{\text{MGH}} - \hat{\beta}{\text{Mayo}}}{\sqrt{SE_{\text{MGH}}^2 + SE_{\text{Mayo}}^2}}
\].

As reported in Column 4, the Z-statistics for each outcome indicate no
statistically significant differences in the estimated effects between
the two settings. This suggests that the impact of batching is mainly
consistent across hospitals despite differences in patient assignment
mechanisms and operational structures. Overall, these results reinforce
the external validity of our findings and provide further evidence that
the observed effects of batching are not merely an artifact of a single
institution's workflow but a systematic consequence of batching in
high-volume emergency care settings.

\subsection{Robustness Checks and Limitations}\label{sec:robustness}

While our research design leverages the random assignment of patients to
physicians to identify causal effects, several limitations warrant
discussion. A primary concern is that physicians' tendency to batch
order tests may correlate with other unobserved practice patterns that
affect our outcomes of interest. Although we found no significant
associations between observable physician characteristics (such as
experience, gender, or training) and the tendency to batch, unobserved
characteristics could influence both the tendency to batch and other
aspects of patient care. For instance, physicians who tend to
batch-order tests might also have different approaches to patient
assessment, documentation practices, or consultation patterns. Each of
these can independently affect LOS and disposition decisions. Removing
the potential impact of such unobserved factors might require a fully
randomized experiment. However, we find consistency and magnitude in our
findings across both 2SLS and UJIVE specifications, with and without
precision controls for laboratory ordering and physician
characteristics, and across two hospitals with different practice
settings. This consistency provides strong evidence behind our findings.
In particular, unobserved physician characteristics would need to be
substantial to invalidate our core finding that batching increases both
test utilization and processing times.

Nevertheless, the validity of our results largely depends on our
identification strategy (Section \ref{sec:identification}). To further
strengthen our confidence, we performed several robustness checks.
First, to address potential many-instrument bias in leniency designs, we
implement the Unbiased Jackknife Instrumental Variables Estimator
(UJIVE). This estimator uses leave-one-out predictions to eliminate
mechanical correlation between the instrument and structural error
\citep{kolesar2015manyinvalid, goldsmithpinkham2025leniencydesignsoperatorsmanual}.
The close agreement between 2SLS and UJIVE estimates across all outcomes
(Table \ref{tab:results_table}) increases confidence that
many-instrument bias is not driving our findings. Second, to address
potential exclusion restriction violations, we conduct sensitivity
analyses following \citet{conley2012plausibly}. These analyses allow for
plausible direct effects of the instrument on outcomes, and our
estimates remain significant across a wide range of assumed violation
magnitudes (Figure EC.8.1). Third, we conduct a placebo test by applying
our BatchTendency instrument (constructed from the main analytical
sample) to a placebo sample consisting of rarely batched complaint
categories where no imaging tests were ordered. We find null effects on
outcomes in this placebo sample (Table EC.7.1), supporting the idea that
batch tendency captures batching-specific behavior rather than general
physician practice intensity. We acknowledge that we cannot definitively
rule out all exclusion restriction violations. We note that to the
extent batch tendency captures general physician intensity, our
reduced-form estimates still provide the causal effect of being assigned
to a high-batching physician.

We also check robustness to other outcome measures. Treatment time,
meaning time from doctor contact to disposition (excluding waiting and
post-disposition delays), shows no material difference by treatment
(Table EC.10.1). For 72-hour returns, regardless of admission, effects
remain small and statistically insignificant (Table EC.11.2). For
nonlinear models (logit for binary outcomes, Poisson for counts),
average marginal effects are similar to linear IV estimates (Table
EC.9.1).

To assess whether our results generalize to different clinical
scenarios, we conduct heterogeneity analyses across seven chief
complaint categories that vary in complexity and prevalence of batching.
In every category, we observe the same key patterns: batching increases
imaging without efficiency gains or quality improvements (Figure
\ref{fig:heterogeneity}). Our findings are thus not driven by a specific
complaint type, which increases confidence in the general applicability
of our results.

To address monotonicity, we follow established methods and check whether
our instrument has a positive first-stage coefficient across subsamples
defined by complaint, severity, capacity, and demographics (Figure
EC.6.1). We consistently find stable effect sizes and implications
across all robustness checks. Taken together, these robustness analyses
give us further confidence in our main conclusion that batching reliably
increases imaging and processing delays.

Beyond these methodological considerations, several scope limitations
warrant acknowledgment. First, we cannot determine the extent to which
the additional imaging from batching represents unnecessary testing
versus frontloading of diagnostics that would eventually occur in the
inpatient setting. However, interpreting our findings purely as
frontloading is complicated by the fact that admission itself is
affected by batching. For example, we observe a 39 percentage-point
increase in admission probability, suggesting that the tests themselves
influence disposition decisions rather than simply shifting testing
location. Multiple mechanisms may operate simultaneously. Some
additional tests may reveal genuinely admission-worthy conditions, while
others may trigger defensive admissions through incidental findings.
Distinguishing between these pathways would require linked ED-inpatient
imaging data; accordingly, this remains an important direction for
future research. To address this concern directly, we re-estimated our
main specifications, restricting the sample to patients who were
ultimately discharged from the ED. This subsample is informative
because, by construction, these patients do not receive subsequent
inpatient diagnostic workups, which eliminates the possibility that ED
imaging merely substitutes for tests that would have occurred during
hospitalization. As shown in Table EC.11.1, the estimated effect of
batching on the number of distinct imaging tests remains large,
positive, and statistically significant across UJIVE and 2SLS
specifications. Magnitudes are comparable to those in the full sample.

Second, our findings apply to moderate-to-high acuity patients with
complaints that commonly require multiple imaging studies. This group
accounts for approximately 24\% of ED encounters and 41\% of imaging
resource utilization. In contrast, the effects of batching in low-acuity
or fast-track settings remain unexplored, as imaging is less common and
batching is rare in these contexts. Our sample restrictions, therefore,
ensure statistical identification and focus on the clinically meaningful
population where batching decisions are consequential and discretionary.
As a result, readers should interpret our estimates as applying to this
specific margin of physician decision-making.

\subsection{Managerial Implications}\label{sec:implications}

Our findings have important implications for the management of ED
operations. First, while potentially appealing as a workflow efficiency
strategy, batch ordering of imaging tests significantly increases ED LOS
and resource utilization without corresponding improvements in patient
outcomes. The substantial magnitude of these effects---a 65\% increase
in LOS and 88\% increase in imaging tests for discretionarily batched
patients---suggests that ED managers should carefully evaluate policies
around physician test ordering. As our decomposition analysis suggests,
a meaningful share of these delays operates through increased diagnostic
intensity, reinforcing that standard practice serves as a natural filter
against unnecessary testing. These findings support Hypotheses 1--3:
discretionary batching increases test volume, lengthens processing
times, and raises admission probability.

The significant variation we observe in batching behavior across
physicians treating similar patients suggests an opportunity for
standardization. ED managers might consider implementing
decision-support systems that encourage sequential ordering,
particularly in conditions where information from initial tests often
eliminates the need for additional imaging. Notably, our heterogeneity
analysis shows that the operational inefficiencies of batching persist
across all capacity levels---effects are statistically indistinguishable
whether the ED is operating normally or under overcapacity (contrary to
Hypothesis 4). This suggests that interventions to reduce unnecessary
batching are warranted across all levels of capacity utilization, not
only during periods of normal capacity.

The substantial cost implications of batch ordering---both in terms of
operational efficiency and resource utilization---suggest that EDs could
benefit from more-structured approaches to test ordering. Though
preserving physician autonomy in clinical decision making is crucial,
our results indicate that full discretion in test ordering timing may
lead to suboptimal system performance. Simple interventions, such as
providing physicians with feedback on their batching rates relative to
peers or implementing decision-support systems that suggest sequential
ordering pathways, could help reduce unnecessary testing while
maintaining care quality. Our determinants analysis suggests that such
interventions may be particularly valuable early in physician shifts,
when batching is most prevalent. To better understand the magnitude of
these opportunities, we quantify the financial burden of discretionary
batching.

Combining our causal estimates with published cost parameters (see EC.5
for details), we adopt a societal perspective using Medicare-allowed
reimbursement of \$130 per ED radiograph \citep{dabus2025practice} and
ED bed-hour costs of \$85 based on time-driven activity-based costing
studies \citep[\citet{canellas2024measurement}]{schreyer2017economics}.
Under deliberately conservative assumptions, discretionary batching
imposes at least \$349 in direct costs per batched complier: \$125 from
excess imaging and \$224 from excess ED bed utilization. Scaling to
annual operations, this amounts to approximately \$232,000 per year for
a medium-sized ED (40,000 annual visits) and \$349,000 for a large urban
ED (Table EC.5.1). These estimates represent conservative lower bounds,
include only statistically significant imaging effects (excluding
ultrasound and CT point estimates), value bed-hours at operational cost
rather than throughput value, and exclude downstream costs from the 40
percentage point increase in admission probability. Inpatient stays cost
\$10,000--15,000, which would dwarf our direct cost estimates. Notably,
we find no offsetting benefits: 72-hour return rates are statistically
indistinguishable between strategies. Even under these conservative
assumptions, a 50\% reduction in discretionary batching would save about
\$116,000 annually while freeing 850 bed-hours of capacity.

Finally, our findings have implications beyond individual EDs, as
increased admission rates from batch ordering create spillover effects
throughout the hospital system. Discretionary batching increases
admission probability by 40 percentage points, raising patient volumes
in inpatient units and potentially inducing speed-up behaviors that can
compromise care quality. Hospital administrators should consider these
downstream impacts when developing imaging protocols and resource
allocation strategies. The consistency of our findings across two
institutions with different patient populations and assignment
mechanisms (Mayo Clinic and MGH) suggests these patterns are not
idiosyncratic to a single setting, strengthening the case for broader
policy attention to diagnostic test sequencing in emergency care.

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

Although previous research examines task ordering within centralized
protocols, frontline physicians often control when and how they order
diagnostic tests, especially in high-pressure settings like EDs. In
practice, due to system design or individual choice, doctors self-manage
their test-ordering strategies. Because little research addresses the
operational impact of test ordering, healthcare managers have limited
guidance when physician discretion is involved. Understanding when and
how doctors exercise this discretion helps inform system design,
encourages better use of discretion, and guides policy to accommodate
frontline clinician behaviors.

We address this gap by analyzing the drivers and effects of batch
ordering imaging tests in the ED. Using detailed data from two large
U.S. EDs---one with random patient-physician assignment---we find that
physicians are more likely to batch imaging tests early in their shifts
and when the ED is less crowded. This suggests time pressure and ED
occupancy measurably influence batching, indicating that physicians
adjust orders based on workload and operational demands.

Our results show that batch ordering of imaging tests significantly
increases the number of imaging studies performed per patient encounter,
thereby increasing resource utilization. We find no evidence that
batching reduces patient length of stay (LOS) in the ED or affects
72-hour return admissions. Instead, discretionary batching increases
both time spent in the ED and time to disposition, indicating
substantial inefficiencies from initiating multiple diagnostic imaging
processes at once. Furthermore, batch ordering substantially increases
the probability of hospital admission, with important downstream
implications for hospital capacity and patient flow. This supports prior
research suggesting sequential test ordering can minimize unnecessary
tests by allowing earlier results to inform further decisions. Our
findings suggest that while physician discretion can tailor test
ordering, it may also promote practices that raise resource use and
inefficiency without benefiting patients or the ED system.

Our comparison of batch ordering versus standard practice reflects the
real choice facing ED managers: should protocols encourage comprehensive
upfront testing or preserve diagnostic flexibility? Our estimates show
that preserving optionality through standard practice---which allows
information from initial tests to guide subsequent decisions---reduces
both testing intensity and processing times without compromising care
quality. The consistency of these findings across seven chief complaint
categories, from simple presentations like fevers to complex polytrauma
cases (Figure \ref{fig:heterogeneity}), simplifies policy
recommendations. Interventions to reduce discretionary batching appear
warranted across the full spectrum of ED presentations rather than being
limited to particular clinical scenarios.

Excess ED testing is not harmless. It increases risks such as
unnecessary radiation and both psychological and physical burdens from
incidental findings \citep{Mus2011}. The economic impact is substantial,
with test overuse adding to healthcare costs \citep{Atkinson2023}. Our
results point to the need to study batching across clinical conditions
and settings beyond the ED, considering effects on hospital metrics
\citep[\citet{saghafian2019role}]{Saghafian2019}.

Our study underscores the importance of developing evidence-based
guidelines to inform physicians' test ordering strategies. By
understanding how batching impacts patient outcomes and ED operations,
healthcare managers can design interventions to optimize test ordering
practices. This may include providing decision-support tools, adjusting
policies to encourage sequential ordering when appropriate, or offering
physicians feedback on their ordering patterns and associated outcomes.
By aligning physician test-ordering strategies more closely with patient
needs \citep{Atkinson2023}, EDs can enhance patient satisfaction and
outcomes while improving operational efficiency.
